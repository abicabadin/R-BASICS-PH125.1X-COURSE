#FUNCTIONS
#DATA TYPES
#CODE
# loading the dslabs package and the murders dataset
library(dslabs)
data(murders)

# determining that the murders dataset is of the "data frame" class
class(murders)
# finding out more about the structure of the object
str(murders)
# showing the first 6 lines of the dataset
head(murders)

# using the accessor operator to obtain the population column
murders$population
# displaying the variable names in the murders dataset
names(murders)
# determining how many entries are in a vector
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
# vectors can be of class numeric and character
class(pop)
class(murders$state)

# logical vectors are either TRUE or FALSE
z <- 3 == 2
z
class(z)

# factors are another type of class
class(murders$region)
# obtaining the levels of a factor
levels(murders$region)


#VECTORS
# We may create vectors of class numeric or character with the concatenate function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy", "canada", "egypt")

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector
# Note that the two lines of code below have the same result
codes <- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
codes <- c("italy" = 380, "canada" = 124, "egypt" = 818)

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector using the names() function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy","canada","egypt")
names(codes) <- country

# Using square brackets is useful for subsetting to access specific elements of a vector

# If the entries of a vector are named, they may be accessed by referring to their name

#SORTING
#CODE
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
sort(murders$total)

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
sort(x)    # puts elements in order

index <- order(x)    # returns index that will put x in order
x[index]    # rearranging by this index puts elements in order
order(x)

murders$state[1:10]
murders$abb[1:10]

index <- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[index]    # order abbreviations by total murders

max(murders$total)    # highest number of total murders
i_max <- which.max(murders$total)    # index with highest number of murders
murders$state[i_max]    # state name with highest number of total murders

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
rank(x)    # returns ranks (smallest to largest)


#VECTOR ARITHMETIC
# The name of the state with the maximum population is found by doing the following
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]

# how to obtain the murder rate
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

# ordering the states by murder rate, in decreasing order
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]


#INDEXING 
#CODE
# defining murder rate as before
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
# creating a logical vector that specifies if the murder rate in that state is less than or equal to 0.71
index <- murder_rate <= 0.71
# determining which states have murder rates less than or equal to 0.71
murders$state[index]
# calculating how many states have a murder rate less than or equal to 0.71
sum(index)

# creating the two logical vectors representing our conditions
west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1
# defining an index and identifying states with both conditions true
index <- safe & west
murders$state[index]


#INDEXING FUNCTIONS
x <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
which(x)    # returns indices that are TRUE

# to determine the murder rate in Massachusetts we may do the following
index <- which(murders$state == "Massachusetts")
index
murder_rate[index]

# to obtain the indices and subsequent murder rates of New York, Florida, Texas, we do:
index <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
index
murders$state[index]
murder_rate[index]

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
y <- c("a", "d", "f")
y %in% x

# to see if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states
c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state

#BAsIC PLOT
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data("murders")

# a simple scatterplot of total murders versus population
x <- murders$population /10^6
y <- murders$total

# a histogram of murder rates
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)
