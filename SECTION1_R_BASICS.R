#CODE: SOLVING THE EQUATION x^2 + x - 1 + 0
# assigning values to variables
a <-1
b <-1

# solving the quadratic equation

#FUNCTIONS
#DATA TYPES
#CODE
# loading the dslabs package and the murders dataset
library(dslabs)
data(murders)

# determining that the murders dataset is of the "data frame" class
class(murders)
# finding out more about the structure of the object
str(murders)
# showing the first 6 lines of the dataset
head(murders)

# using the accessor operator to obtain the population column
murders$population
# displaying the variable names in the murders dataset
names(murders)
# determining how many entries are in a vector
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
# vectors can be of class numeric and character
class(pop)
class(murders$state)

# logical vectors are either TRUE or FALSE
z <- 3 == 2
z
class(z)

# factors are another type of class
class(murders$region)
# obtaining the levels of a factor
levels(murders$region)


#VECTORS
# We may create vectors of class numeric or character with the concatenate function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy", "canada", "egypt")

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector
# Note that the two lines of code below have the same result
codes <- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
codes <- c("italy" = 380, "canada" = 124, "egypt" = 818)

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector using the names() function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy","canada","egypt")
names(codes) <- country

# Using square brackets is useful for subsetting to access specific elements of a vector
codes[2]
codes[c(1,3)]
codes[1:2]

# If the entries of a vector are named, they may be accessed by referring to their name
codes["canada"]

#SORTING
#CODE
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
sort(murders$total)

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
sort(x)    # puts elements in order

index <- order(x)    # returns index that will put x in order
x[index]    # rearranging by this index puts elements in order
order(x)

murders$state[1:10]
murders$abb[1:10]

index <- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[index]    # order abbreviations by total murders

max(murders$total)    # highest number of total murders
i_max <- which.max(murders$total)    # index with highest number of murders
murders$state[i_max]    # state name with highest number of total murders

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
rank(x)    # returns ranks (smallest to largest)


#VECTOR ARITHMETIC
# The name of the state with the maximum population is found by doing the following
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]

# how to obtain the murder rate
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

# ordering the states by murder rate, in decreasing order
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]
