# R-BASICS-PH125.1X-COURSE

Welcome to the READ ME section from my R basic course exercises completed through HarvardX. 
This repository contains my solutions and reports for the exercises covered in the course, aimed at mastering the fundamentals of R programming.
Each file contains instructions and R scripts used to solve the exercises and document my approach. 

Thank you.
